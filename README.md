# Quarkus OpenAPI Problem: Standardized Error Responses for Quarkus REST APIs using Problem Details (RFC9457)

### üöÄ Overview
This repository aims to provide standardized error responses for Quarkus REST APIs using the Problem Details format as defined in RFC9457. By following this approach, developers can ensure consistency in error handling across their Quarkus applications, making it easier to understand and debug issues.

### üì¶ Repository Details
- **Repository Name**: quarkus-openapi-problem
- **Description**: Standardized error responses for Quarkus REST APIs using Problem Details (RFC9457)
- **Topics**: error, exception, jackson, jakarta-rest, jaxrs, json, openapi, problem, quarkus-extension, rest, resteasy, rfc9457

### ‚ö° Features
1. **Standardized Error Responses**: Implementing the RFC9457 standard ensures that error responses are consistent and well-defined.
2. **Easy Integration**: This solution can be easily integrated into existing Quarkus projects using REST APIs.
3. **Improved Debugging**: Clear error responses help developers quickly identify and solve issues in their applications.

### üåü How to Use
To integrate the standardized error responses into your Quarkus application, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Copy the necessary files into your Quarkus project.
3. Update your exception handling to return responses in the RFC9457 format.

```java
@Provider
public class CustomExceptionHandler implements ExceptionMapper<MyCustomException> {

    @Override
    public Response toResponse(MyCustomException exception) {
        Problem problem = new Problem(); // Create a new Problem Details response
        problem.setStatus(Status.NOT_FOUND);
        problem.setTitle("Resource Not Found");
        problem.setDetail(exception.getMessage());
        
        return Response.status(problem.getStatus().getStatusCode())
                .entity(problem)
                .type(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
                .build();
    }
}
